Project Dyn:Ammo
================

An open source Matlab based toolbox for the needs of macroeconomists. 

Rather brief outline of the Project functionality is listed below.

Treatment of dynamic macro models featuring:
	- JAVA based user interface for a user-friendly model declaration
	- Robust solution of rational expectations models
	- Stable filtering techniques
	- Flexible model simulation
	- Symbolic differentiation
	- Nonlinear modeling using neural networks

Time series management featuring:
	- Easy to learn manipulation of yearly/quarterly/monthly and daily data
	- Seasonal adjustment, filtration and interpolation capabilities
	- Frequency conversion
	- Visualization tools
	- Automated time series object creation from EUROSTAT data 
		(using SDMX standard)
	- Data input/output from/to delimited text files, or .XLS files on Windows machines

Platform independent reporting capabilities (as an interface to external PDF rendering engines)

==================

Title:
EUROSTAT data downloading facility

Summary:
Automated data importing tool with time series management and visualization capabilities

Descr.:
This code library makes it easy to import most of EUROSTAT macroeconomic data directly into Matlab. Time series manipulation and advanced plotting functionality have been implemented using special Matlab objects.

A GUI has been programmed for browsing the EUROSTAT database contents and the data selection.

"TUTORIALS" folder contains well documented scripts.

Installation: All folders must be added to Matlab search path, including subfolders.

Other Requirements:
Allocation of Java heap memory must be increased (1 GB should be enough)
