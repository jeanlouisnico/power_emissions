 EUROSTAT data downloading facility - readme
 ===========================================

 This code library facilitates importing most of EUROSTAT 
 macroeconomic data directly into Matlab. Time series 
 manipulation and advanced plotting functionality have been 
 implemented using special user-defined objects. 

 A GUI has been programmed for browsing the EUROSTAT database 
 contents and the data selection.
 
 TUTORIALS folder contains well documented scripts. 

 Compatibility:
 --------------
 Only Matlab BASE is needed, additional toolboxes are not required.
 The codes have been tested on M2010b, M2012b, M2015b, M2011A (Mac version)

 Installation:
 -------------
 1] All folders on this level must be added to the Matlab search 
    path, including subfolders.

 2] If you are behind a proxy server, the Matlab preferences must be 
    set up accordingly. Navigate to "Preferences" pane, click "Web" 
    and set properly the Proxy host and proxy port. To check whether
    your computer is behind a proxy, you can quickly check 
    the Internet Explorer Options (on Windows machines), or 
    the System/Network preferences (on Mac OS X machines)

 3] Default amount of Matlab JAVA heap memory in 
        "Preferences/General/Java Heap Memory"
    must be increased to +/-400 MB.
    Restart of Matlab is needed for the above changes to take effect!
