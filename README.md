## Pre-requisite

to run the model, you will need to have access to a PostgreSQL instance, either local or on a server that you have access to. The access to the PostgreSQL is set up in the beginning of the model and has to be run once. Changes can be made at any time by running the setup file again.

### Create database

Before starting the model, you will have to setup a database in PostgreSQL. You can name it the way you want as long as you defined it correctly in the *setupfetcher.m* command later.
